The rover model is intended to simulate the objectives of extraplanetary exploration by investigating the surroundings for extraterrestrial habitability, ancient life and more generally the physical properties of the environment. In order to search for evidence of organic compounds and other biosignatures as well as study the environment, the rover is equipped with several sensors and instruments with which it can analyze atmospheric and environmental conditions, and cache soil and mineral samples.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The rover developed in this project is inspired by the general design and proportions of Sawppy the Rover (version 1.0); an open-source motorized model of Mars rovers Curiosity and Perseverance. Sawppy was originally developed utilizing JPL's Open Source Rover project (Cheng, n.d.; Sawppy the Rover, n.d.). This project’s rover design has been adapted to feature a remotely operated robotic arm and a host of sensors and instruments for performing geological and climatological analyses. The chassis of the rover is constructed from aluminum extrusion beams connected by bespoke 3D-printed Polylactic acid (PLA) components. The rover’s six wheels are operated by serial servo actuated motors and feature the Rocker-Bogie suspension kinematics of traditional planetary rovers. On-board instrumentation consists of servo-controlled photoresistors that guide photovoltaic (PV) panels for supplying power to the rover. One servo-mounted and two frame-mounted ultrasound sensors (HC-SR04) are equipped to enable proximate navigational capabilities. A nRF24L01 Transceiver, servo-actuated FC-28 soil humidity detector, ambient environment sensor (BME 280) for temperature and pressure and Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver are additionally mounted to the rover. The rover is equipped with a specialized servo-operated robotic arm and an excavation bucket attachment end, along with a motorized retractable tray for storing and sorting sample material. The rover’s components, instruments, and hardware housing mounts were developed using Autodesk’s Fusion 360 Computer-aided Design (CAD) software. Each component was designed individually and assessed for functionality before being assembled to the rover in CAD. Finalized components were subsequently exported as STL files and 3D printed. The printed PLA components were then physically assembled, connected to servo motors, wired to an Arduino microcontroller board and attached to the rover. The rover was intended to have fully autonomous mapping functions and pathfinding capabilities for navigating to specified locations and performing operations of interest, such as procuring experimental samples and environmental data (Weisbin, 1999).&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>In essence, the objective of this research project was to design and assembly a functional extraplanetary prototype model and successfully conduct an experimental mission in Maastricht, Netherlands. More specifically, the goal was to navigate the rover remotely from the initial “landing site” to a specified destination and subsequently execute a scientific operation comprised of examination of soil humidity, ambient temperature, geolocation, and remote operation of the robotic arm to procure a soil sample to be cached in the retractable storage tray.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p></div>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p>This section of the report is divided into two subparts based on their applications, namely hardware and software. In the hardware part, the assembly of the robot as well as the different compartments and their connections are described. The software section details the main operating systems used for the design, coding and control of the rover.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Hardware&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Arduino Mega 2560/ Raspberry Pi 4 Model B</strong></p><p>The brain of the project was a RaspberryPi 4 Model B; a micro computer that can be used for general computing, but also has very useful features for robotics. This is due to it’s small size, small power consumption and a set of usable GPIO pins on the board that allow the connection of external modules and sensors. This also makes the RaspberryPi the perfect device to use as a web server or autonomous robot controller. We chose to go for a 4Gb RAM model as this would make processing commands from the web server and parsing sensor data more efficient (The Raspberry Pi Foundation, 2019). In addition, we used an Arduino Mega 2560 microcontroller (chosen for its 54 digital input/output pins) as the interface between the processing unit and the sensors (Dummies &amp; Nussey, 2018). This was done to leave spare pins on the Raspberry pi to control the robotic arm and radar servos and not clog its processing capabilities with data collection, as an Arduino can do the same in parallel and simply send the data afterwards through the serial, for safe storage into an SQLite database.</p><p>These two boards are linked through a USB cable that allows for the data transmission, meaning that only the Raspberry Pi is directly connected to the battery. Our choice of battery (GOLDBAT LiPo, 2S, 7.4V, 5200mAh, 38.48WH) allows for the whole system to be powered with only one battery pack. Two buck converters (LM2596) were used as regulators to decrease the voltage from the battery, as to satisfy the components’ 5V maximum input from an external source. Both microcontrollers had their own 3D-printed casings, which were fitted onto the rover’s bottom plexiglass plate.</p><p><strong>Servo Motor</strong></p><p>The servo motors chosen for the actuation of the rover for this project are the LewanSoul LX-16A from LOBOT, rated for 17kg of torque. They come with a LOBOT board that allows for serial bus control through the use of a USB cable. This facilitates the programming and the control of the servo as with this system, they can all be assembled and linked to one another. Additionally, for some of the modules of the rover, such as the robotic arm, the photovoltaic panel and the radar, smaller servo motors were utilized, namely SG90 Micro Servos 9g and MG996R high torque servos, due to their lighter structure.</p><p><strong>Temperature/Pressure Sensor</strong></p><p>Environmental data such as outside temperature, pressure and humidity were measured with the BME280/BMP280. This highly efficient sensor was ideal to minimize load on the whole system. This left computational power and raw battery power to the higher order functions of the rover such as communication to the server and movement.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Soil Moisture Sensor</strong></p><p>The soil moisture sensor consists of two plates, which together make one probe, with which the difference in resistance between the two can be measured. One of the two conducting plates is connected to a 5V supply through a series resistance of 10k Ohm. The other is connected to the ground. Together the sensor forms a voltage divider bias network. The output of the sensor is in reverse proportion to the soil water content, with the first getting higher as the latter gets lower. The first terminal of the sensor pin gives the output of the sensor, which is in volts within a range of zero and five depending on the soil water content. Under ideal circumstances, when the water content is at zero, the output should be 5V as the sensor should act as an open circuit. However, instead of that the analog output of the sensor must be used. The analog output is converted using an Analog to Digital Converter (ADC). This gives an output in the range of 0 and 1023. The output can be is then mapped to the moisture level of the soil:</p><p><em>AnalogOutput = ADC Value1023</em></p><p><em>Moisture in % = 100 - (AnalogOutput*100)</em></p><p>When the moisture percentage is 0%, you get the max value of the ADC, which is 1023. Using both equations, the soil water content can be estimated in percentages.</p><p><strong>nRF24L01 Transceiver</strong></p><p>The nRF24L01 radio wave transceiver (2.4GHz ISM Freq. Band) was used to communicate with the rover using a joystick GUI on a remote laptop. In order to improve the range of communication, a Power Amplifier (PA) antenna module was attached to the transceiver. With the PA, the range of communication was increased to approximately 1000m in a clear line of sight.</p><p><strong>Ultrasound Pseudo Radar</strong></p><p>To gather information about its surroundings, the rover was fitted with a panning ultrasound sensor which covered the forward 180°. The mount for this was a simple housing and servo design able to turn to a specified angle. This design was chosen for several reasons, the most prominent being availability of ultrasound components and high cost of an alternative LIDAR/RADAR system. Although the ultrasound component can only return a single distance value, through the use of accurate positioning from the servo, these values can be processed into a pseudo-radar capable of detecting objects in its vicinity (Vedder, Benjamin, et al.,2015).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Swivel Photoresistor (Photovoltaic Panel)</strong></p><p>In order to maximize the electricity generated from the rover’s solar panel, it was necessary to have a 2-axis mount for the panels. This mount would allow the panel to remain pointed at the sun throughout the day, maximizing the electricity generated. The mount was designed around two servo motors, allowing for higher angular accuracy when compared to a design using stepper motors. The solar panel mount was designed to minimize the strain on either servo, and so a combination of gears was used to transfer the weight onto stronger components. This solar panel mount was designed to be used in conjunction with a directional photoresistor so that there was no dependency on either GPS (for earth-based operations) or calculations regarding the sun’s position in the sky (Rizk, Y.Chaiko, 2008).</p><p><strong>GPS Receiver&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A big part of our navigation on earth is done via Global Positioning System or short GPS. Obviously such a system would not work on other planets without the right infrastructure since this technology is relying on multiple available satellites in a planet's orbit. Though for future use, GPS (GPS6MV2) was included to assure route tracking and enable better autonomy while training on site. Using the freely available satellites in earth's orbit, the data extrapolated from various encoded NMEA sentences shows the position in coordinates of latitude, longitude, altitude and velocity of the rover (NEO-6M GPS Module, 2019).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Robotic Arm</strong></p><p>As part of a realistic simulation of the utilities a functional mars rover may possess, the decision to design, manufacture, and incorporate a robotic excavator arm for the collection and deposition of soil samples was made. Two main design ideas were considered with the main difference being either to choose a hand design capable of grabbing and handling solid material but lacks the ability to scoop and move granular samples such as soil, or also liquid. An excavator bucket design was chosen in the end as it could both collect granular samples and also potentially collect small solid objects such as rocks. The arm in totality was designed to be modular to potentially have pieces swapped out to accommodate different scenarios. Another advantage to a modular design is the ability to easily disassemble and replace broken components or during the initial construction tweaks can be made to individual pieces without interfering with the rest of the arm.&nbsp;</p><p>In total 8 components were designed on Fusion 360 and later one of each was printed, save the ‘nut’ and ‘bolt design’ files of which three each were printed. The first component file ‘arm mount’ can be considered as a mounting piece responsible for attaching the rest of the arm to the chassis of the rover as well as housing the first of three MG996R servo motors. The next two pieces could be considered as arm joints, responsible for creating length in the arm and creating a degree of movement necessary for the extension and contraction of the arm. The second arm section also houses an MG996R servo motor which is responsible for driving the scooping motion in the excavator piece. The excavator bucket functions using a servo mounted on the final arm component to rotate the bucket through an axis where it is attached to the same arm piece. This was intended to translate to a scooping movement when combined with a contracting motion by the second servo motion. The arm is unable to pivot left and right and relies on the rover’s ability to position itself correctly for sample procuring.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Sample Storage Tray</strong></p><p>The different samples that were collected by the robotic arm needed to be stored in a sampling tray, located on the bottom part of the rover’s frame. This tray was also designed in a similar manner as the arm, through the software of Fusion 360. The tray was given a trilateral shape, with an inclination of 42 degrees , and dimensions of 180 x 90 x 100 . As the tray was positioned on the bottom of the rover, it would need to be moved in a linear direction, forwards and backwards. As such, the mechanism behind this movement was a linear actuator working on a DC motor, controlled through the Arduino. The motor (MG996 tower pro)  would rotate a 3D printed gear that would interact with rails on both sides of the tray and create the necessary movement. After the acquisition of the samples, the arm would retract to its original position and the tray would be moved underneath it for the collection of the specimen. On the inclined part of the tray, three grid filters were designed that would separate the samples based on their size. Higher volume samples would reside in a higher point, while the specimen with less volume on the bottom of the tray.</p><p><strong>Rover Construction</strong></p><p>The design of the rover’s main body was already developed by Roger Cheng. Following this design, aluminium rods were cut into the appropriate sizes and assembled as the chassis of the rover. The various modules of the rover would get attached on a plexiglass plate that would act as the mounting point for the components. The main power source was positioned on the back part of the rover and as such, the Arduino and the Raspberry Pi was placed close to it. After all the modules were printed and tested, they were connected to the controlling parts of the rover and mounted on the plexiglass as well (Sawppy the Rover, n.d.).</p><p><strong>3D Printing&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A Creality Ender 3 printer was used to print all the plastic components on the rover. Although the tolerances of this machine are highly dependent on the calibration, all dimensions were expected to be within 0.1 mm. Print times for components vary greatly, with a small print taking &lt;30 minutes, and the largest components (the six wheels) each taking a full 24 hours. With a large amount of components to print, it was necessary to plan the order, and maximise components per print. Some of the rover’s components were printed before the start of the project period, as the design files were already available. Consequently, it was necessary to finalise our component designs in the first two weeks to ensure that they could begin printing. Overall, the 3D printer was used almost continuously throughout the whole project and even this very intense use did not permit the printing of all the designed components.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Software&nbsp;</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>CAD/ Fusion 360</strong></p><p>The software used to design the components was Autodesk’s Fusion 360 Computer-aided Design (CAD) software. Using the software it is possible to create precise 3D STL. files which can in turn be sent to a 3D printer and printed. The main body of the rover had already been designed by previous research. Based on that design, an upgraded version was developed using the CAD software. This software allowed for collaboration between team members, testing the operational functionalities of the rover as well as for it to be assembled, rendered, and animated with the individual designed components.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Autonomy</strong></p><p>The rover was planned to be made autonomous using various machine learning algorithms. It was planned to have object avoidance and autonomous movement from point A to B. It was expected to also perform actions and tests autonomously such as sample extraction and ground moisture tests.  In order to achieve this we needed to somehow visualize and simulate the rover on a computer as extensive training using machine learning algorithms is unfeasible. In order to achieve this we used a Robotic Operating System (ROS) Melodic and Gazebo. ROS is a collection of tools and libraries that are used to make it easier to write software for robots. Gazebo is a tool used for simulating robots and environments and allows users to test algorithms and perform machine learning. Sadly, there were some issues during the implementations of these software (Lacroix, Simon, et al., 2002).</p><p><strong>Arduino (IDE)</strong></p><p>The majority of the sensors were controlled through the Arduino Mega board. For this to happen, the Arduino integrated environment (Arduino IDE) was used. Through this software, the user is allowed to code in the programming languages of C and C++ and send different commands to the circuit at hand. As each component was first designed and tested individually, the code for all the different modules had already been developed. After the assembly of the rover with all its components, the various codes developed were combined (Brover Inc., 2020), this script can be found on the project’s Github, found in the appendix. The final output was set to be one string containing data from all sensors.</p><p><strong>Python Scripts and Database Files</strong></p><p>The scripts were written to log data to the SQLite database, they did not require any special IDEs. All scripts were coded on a text editor (Notepad++) and run through the command line. Any data coming from the serial was parsed by splitting it at the chosen regex, and then logged in a database file stored locally on the Raspberry Pi (Brover Inc., 2020). In order to get a GUI of the data, SQLite Studio was used. The data stored in the database files were then transferred to a dictionary via a python script, and then made available for use within the HTML code of the website on the Flask server hosted by the Raspberry Pi.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p></div>

The Raspberry Pi 4 was mounted on the rover and thus the user has to be in WiFi range of the rover in order to control it. On top of the manual control server, there is also a data collection server hosted on the Pi, it serves as a data visualization tool creating graphs and showing the location of the rover on a map.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></p><p><strong>Testing</strong></p><p>To confirm the capabilities of the rover and all of it’s modules, the rover underwent a series of small tests, eventually to be followed by a final test. The smaller tests were done during the constructing of the rover, simply to see whether the sensors worked. The final test consisted of having the rover travel across approximately 15 meter . The sensors had to take measurements of the surroundings before the trek, once at the halfway point and a final time at the end of the trek. Additionally, the soil sampling operation and the GPS tracking were also tested three times at the same points.&nbsp;</p><p>The test for the sensors is considered a success if they provide feasible data measurements of their surroundings. The photoresistor specifically is considered a success as long as the panel swivels itself so that it’s always facing the sun. The soil sampling operation is considered a success if the rover can take a soil sample with the robot arm and place it within the retractable tray, whereafter which the soil sample gets filtered depending on the mass of the samples. Finally, the GPS test would be considered successful if the GPS shows where the Brover is currently located during the three points of testing, and additionally whilst en route between testing spots. Completion of these procedures would confirm the function of the additional modules and the successful design of the rover build itself.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><br></strong></p></div>

The final Rover build consisted of a functioning remote-controllable rover, however, the autonomous performance remained incomplete. In spite of that, through use of a web server it was possible to control the rover as long as the user is within the range. On the other hand, the numerous sensors that were added all worked as intended. The functionality of the sensors were confirmed by putting the rover through a series of tests (see Testing).</p><p>Besides the rover’s movement and vast array of sensors, further additions to the rover were also made, in the form of a few modules. One of these modules consisted of a robot arm and extendable tray meant for taking and storing soil samples. The rover arm was designed to move solely in a vertical fashion. The arm would move in a preset series of movements which could be remotely triggered from the web server. This was designed to be in sync with the extending movement of the sampling tray. In combination this would allow for the collecting of soil samples and placing them in the filter tray where the samples would be separated by mass in case any rocks or water found themselves in the sample taken. In addition to the soil sampling operation, a GPS functionality was added with which it was possible to track the rover. This could also be used to mark locations where sensor measurements or soil samples were taken in an effort to eventually map out large areas to determine whether there are any patterns in the measurements taken by the sensors.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Hardware&nbsp;</strong></p></div>

Every sensor was connected one by one to an arduino and had their data output analyzed. This procedure confirmed the workings of the sensors. Additionally, the photoresistors of the solar panel were tested in the sense that when activated the solar panel was always pointing at the strongest source of light. This affirmed the functioning of the photoresistors and the code it runs by.&nbsp;</p><p>In order to check the locomotive capabilities of the rover, Brover was placed in a grassy environment and controlled via the web server. The rover was able to drive across the grassy surface despite it being low friction. Thanks to its suspension, the rover easily managed to make its way down the curb. There were some issues with the movement due to the servo motors in the wheels having problems with applying enough torque to move the rover. The source of this complication was identified as a problem with the wheel hubs. The axles were not putting enough pressure on the wheel hubs and were thus slipping instead of turning the wheels.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><br></strong></p></div>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p>There were numerous hardships which had to be overcome during the design and building of the Brover. The components for building the rover came from a variety of sources. Some were 3D-printed, some were bought locally and some were ordered online. This meant that we received components at different times, which limited the amount of work we could do at the start. Despite that, all planned physical components managed to be put onto the Brover.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the issues with planning the addition of extra modules on the rover was the weight distribution. As adding a robotic arm on the front of the rover would bring its center of mass quite a bit forward, it was necessary to move the placement of sensors further back. And when it came to actually incorporating the modules into the rover, it was necessary to drill plenty of holes to fix the modules to the rover. Many elements had to be filed and sandpapered to fit better with other parts. This is caused by the fact that the 3D printer isn’t very precise and the print is affected by atmospheric factors such as temperature and pressure (3DPrintingMentor, n.d.).</p><p>Three types of servos were used on the rover, 17.0 kg torque servos on the wheels and steering columns, and two smaller types of servos for components that were thought to require less torque. One of these two servo types, MG996R servo motors, were used for the robotic arm The weight of the robotic arm components, combined with the reach of the arm, proved to exert torque above the levels that the servo could handle, resulting in the arm being unable to properly articulate at longer reaches. Furthermore, at shorter reaches, where the arm could still articulate, it did not have the necessary strength to perform functions such as scooping soil samples and accurately depositing them in the sample tray. A solution to this may be using stronger servo motors towards the base of the arm, or inversely, using lighter motors and designs further up on the arm. These changes would mean the redesigning of multiple components and reprinting them.&nbsp;</p><p>Due to time constraints, the humidity sensor/ultrasound mount were designed but could not be printed and assembled. As an alternative to the humidity sensor, a pvc pipe was used to provide the panning ultrasound with the necessary vantage point to be able to scan the area surrounding the rover. Although this allowed us to keep using the ultrasound, it prevented us from being able to take humidity readings from the soil in various locations.</p><p>Unfortunately, the sample storage tray could also not be printed due to time constraints. It is convenient that of the components and sensors we designed, the sample storage tray, which is designed to operate with the robotic arm, is one of the two instruments that could not be printed. However, of the three printed and assembled components, two were successfully put into operation. It is important to note that with more time, or perhaps a second 3d printer, it would have been to print and assemble all of the designs.</p><p>The rocker-bogie assembly itself worked as intended, but the wheels occasionally slipped or did not move. Wheel slip is a more complicated issue to fix, as it is more a function of the wheel’s grip on the surface than an internal mechanical issue. In future iterations of this rover project, it may be possible to manufacture the wheels out of a different material, as PLA wheel is not a component with a particularly high coefficient of traction. However, switching to a different material presents further design complications, as a grippier material will inevitably wear out faster, resulting in a shorter wheel lifespan. A wheel not moving is a simpler issue, although harder to fix. A wheel not moving was observed in several tests, usually occurring when the wheel had either been in operation for a long period of time, or when the wheel encountered an obstacle. Both of these situations caused the servo mount to slip on the rover’s axles, resulting in a loss of power. In the original rover design, the axles were designed to have flattened portions, onto which a screw could be tightened, providing a reliable transfer of power. Given the limitations of the tools available, these flattened regions were crudely manufactured using a dremel and circular sanding attachment, to slowly wear a region on the steel axle down, creating a flat area. These areas were much smaller and shallower than originally intended, resulting in less than optimal power transfer. Furthermore, the heat inserts used to provide M3 compatibility on the 3D printed parts began to slip when under large amounts of strain, adding an additional point of failure. These two factors combined resulted in a servo-to-wheel transfer of power with two internal and one external point of failure; the servo to axle, axle to wheel mount, and wheel to ground interfaces. It is possible that with different tools, perhaps an angle grinder or drill press, these flattened regions on the axles could have been more properly manufactured. Furthermore, using heat inserts with better grip, or using components made of a different material, could have mitigated these issues.<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="font-size: 1rem; white-space: pre;">	</span></p><p>In the case of future continuations of this project, it is suggested that the next group perhaps look into functions of the rover in more Mars-like environments. Additional development upon the GUI and programming of the ultrasound sensor and robotic arm is suggested.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p></div>
